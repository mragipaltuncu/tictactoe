# tictactoe
A command line/terminal based TicTacToe game.
The game has alot of bugs.I haven't covered many of them.
It's a beginner's learning project.
In order to play the game you need a Python 3 interpreter. 

To run the game :
Download the files. Open your command line/terminal. Go to tictactoe.py's folder and run it with your python interpreter.
  
  python tictactoe.py
  or
  python3 tictactoe.py
